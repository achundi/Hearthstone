# Hearthstone
due May 7

This project will involve building a program to play a game called “Hearthstone--“. Hearthstone-- is a derivative of the popular online card game Hearthstone, and functions similarly to other collectible card games. The game of Hearthstone--is a game where two players summon creatures to attack each other until their health points are reduced to zero.
