# Hearthstone
due May 7

This project will involve building a program to play a game called “Hearthstone--“. Hearthstone-- is a derivative of the popular online card game Hearthstone, and functions similarly to other collectible card games. The game of Hearthstone-- is a game whereby two players summon creatures to attack each other until their health points are reduced to zero. When this occurs, the player with zero health points loses.
